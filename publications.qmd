### Decomposing the Within-Firm Productivity Gains from Trade: Evidence From India (Accepted, Review of Economics and Statistics)
**Authors:** Mokhtar Tabari, Scott Orr  
**Abstract:** We develop a decomposition of firm-level revenue-based TFP growth into six margins: i) mean quantity-based TFP growth, ii) mean growth in demand shifters, iii) intensive margin specialization effects, iv) scope effects, v) product adding effects, and vi) product dropping effects. We then estimate and decompose firm-level revenue-based TFP gains generated by increased Chinese import competition and input access using Indian manufacturing data. We find evidence of quality upgrading in response to increased output market competition, and that firms tend to add new products that are lower productivity than their incumbent goods in response to increased input access.

### The AI-TPS Framework: Using Generative AI for Active Learning in Principles of Economics
**Authors:** Mokhtar Tabari  
**Abstract:** In economics education, a persistent challenge is the high opportunity cost associated with instructor preparation time for developing active learning exercises. This paper introduces the AI-Generated Think-Pair-Share (AI-TPS) framework, a method that uses generative AI to help instructors efficiently create customized and up-to-date in-class activities. By using AI as a tool for instructor augmentation, the framework reduces the cost of creating engaging learning materials and makes evidence-based pedagogy more feasible and scalable in economics classrooms.

### Effects of using live case studies in a graduate business course
**Authors:** Mokhtar Tabari, Seyed-Reza Hosseinifar, Gelareh Farhadian  
**Abstract:** The study investigates the effectiveness of using live case studies in graduate business courses to improve students' power skills, critical thinking, and problem-solving. A randomized control trial design was used, and students were assigned to either a control or treatment group. Results show that students in the treatment group report higher levels of confidence in real-business problem-solving, communication, and leadership compared to those in the control group. The findings suggest that incorporating live case studies into business coursework can enhance student learning and prepare them for success in their professional careers.
